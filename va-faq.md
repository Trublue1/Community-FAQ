🟠 🟠 🟠  Methods of obtaining a GPU

1️⃣  QR Raffle Style

🔸 QR Raffle Style system goes LIVE at 9:00 AM and CLOSES at 9:30 AM

🔸 We encourage you to be on site by 9:00 AM to scan the QR code seen on a sheet taped to the window near the entrance area before the window closes.

         ⚠️Do NOT crowd the entrance area out of respect for in-store customers. Stay nearby your vehicle away from the store. 

🔸 You will be given instructions upon scanning the QR code via mobile. Carefully follow the instructions given to you and ensure you receive a CONFIRMATION TEXT at the end of the sign up process. 

🔸 Random selection will commence at 9:45 AM where selected winners will be advised via TEXT to walk up to the front entrance to get a voucher from FFX Management.

🔸 If you are called up to the front entrance to make your selection but do not see any card(s) you want, you must FORFEIT your voucher. You will need to re-present your ID again to confirm you were verified by the employee who handed you a voucher. You must bring the voucher to a cashier at check-out area where you hand them the voucher and they will retrieve the card assigned to the voucher. 

         ⚠️ An employee WILL verify your identity ; you MUST have a Driver's License at the time of receiving a voucher or your selection will be discarded. All vouchers will be numbered.

🔸  Individuals with numbered vouchers will be asked to stand in a line in order to purchase a card at this point in time. ALL CARDS ARE FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED FOR WINNERS HOLDING A VOUCHER.

🔸 If you are called up to the counter to make your selection but do not see any card(s) you want, you must FORFEIT your voucher. You will need to re-present your ID again to confirm you were verified by the employee who handed you a voucher. 

          ⚠️  You CANNOT trade/sell or give away the voucher as it will be voided if you decide not to purchase anything at the counter

🔸 If you did not receive a text around 10:45 AM or LATER,  this means there are no CARDS available for purchase. Try again another day. 

          ⚠️  Keep in mind estimated time above is dependent on number of cards that arrives; the larger the GPU shipment is, the longer it will take to clear the QR Raffle queue.

2️⃣  GPU RESERVATION SYSTEM - PILOT PROGRAM BY CORPORATE

🔸 GPU Reservation stock comes straight from Corporate and is separate from standard truck deliveries in regard to stock for full builds & QR Raffle.

🔸 Head on over to BYO section and ask if the GPU Reservation system is open for new entries.

           ⚠️ You MUST be present in-person in order to validate your entry.

🔸  You will pick a specific model of card (e.g. AMD 6900XT, Nvidia 3080Ti), but will not be able to specify the specific AIB partner/flavor of card (e.g. Asus White Strix 3080).

            ⚠️  You can make changes to your reservation switching cards after your reservation is confirmed anytime.

🔸 You must provide ID, #, email, address, choice of card to validate your reservation.

🔸 Once above step is done, you will receive two links, one by text and one by email which you must complete otherwise your reservation is not saved. 

🔸  The system will automatically review your reservation to confirm no recent GPU purchases in the last 30 days. Your reservation will be canceled if the system shows a recent GPU purchase.

🔸 You WILL be notified by EMAIL containing information about the card including the brand & pricing when it is ready for pickup

           ⚠️  All updates in regard to the wait list for GPU RESERVATION SYSTEM will be available for viewing in 📦-va-stock-alerts

:CS_AlphabetF: :CS_AlphabetA: :CS_AlphabetQ:

⏺️ Where is the Manifest?
It will be posted at the front entrance taped to a shopping cart/window on a QR lottery day.

⏺️ Because FFX implemented the QR Raffle style system, does this mean the GPU Reservation system is canceled altogether, including confirmed reservations?
No - GPU Reservation System is still in EFFECT and will continue as planned. If there are any updates regarding this, we will update FAQ accordingly and do a ping for FFX users.

⏺️ What kind of cards can we expect to land at FFX?
FFX MC places orders for any cards they can get their hands on and is fulfilled by the distributor. They have no say in which brands they want to see more of. 

⏺️ What time should we start camping out?
Overnight lines is NO longer viable. You MUST be there IN PERSON by 9:00 AM to scan the QR code in order to be entered into the raffle system on a scheduled truck day.

⏺️ Do pre-builds get priority for GPUs arriving via the truck?
Yes, FFX Staff will set aside some (or most) cards to meet other customers’ needs, including pre-builds. 

⏺️ Can I get two GPU’s in less than 30 days?
No – you are subject to a 30D CD (30 day cooldown period) where you can only purchase one GPU per 30 days.

⏺️ I just got a graphics card. My (family member) wants to get one too. Can they get a card?
Unfortunately no, they will not be able to get a card. Current Corporate Policy mandates 1 GPU per household per 30 days. This rule is subject to change at the discretion of Corporate Micro Center, however.

⏺️ Unable to view pricing for GPUs?
These are the following steps you must take in order to view pricing:
-Access Micro Center's website
-Type in the GPU you want to see the pricing for
-Change your “local store” to “shippable items” 
-Refresh the page and you will see pricing for said part.

⏺️ What happens to reserved cards (via GPU Reservation System) that aren't picked up?
The cards stays within the GPU Reservation System - it will not be available for sale in-store.
