-General-

1. Don't be a dipwad in this chat, or else you will be treated as such and likely removed. We are all humble people (for the most part). Stirring trouble will yield you no benefit. â‚’â‚™â‚›
2. Known delivery (truck) days are indeterminate at this time, if you have info to update we'll do our best
3. Live stock updates from those at the store belong in ðŸ“¦-ks-stock-alerts . Do not post questions in the alerts channel
4. Questions belong in ðŸ’¬-ks-general-chat . If your message was deleted from the updates channel, try again in chat
5. DO NOT share the QR code or any other information relating to raffle registration. It is meant only for those present at the store
6. If there is not a QR code posted in the morning, there is not likely to be new inventory at opening - any stock left over from a prior day is a first come, first serve
7. Phone calls appear to be routed to the national call center at this time 
-Random Selection Process (line replacement)-

KS, Overland Park - Waitlist entry time 8:30 AM - 9:00 AM
https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-process-and-faq
On days when a store receives a shipment of video cards, a random selection waitlist or virtual line will be implemented. The opening time of the virtual line may vary from store to store as some receive their shipment in the morning and some in the afternoon. Please see the list of stores after the example document below for more detailed information on when to enter the queue.

Once the virtual line is opened, you scan the QR Code supplied on a handout at your local store. Scanning the QR code will take you to a form with instructions on how to get added to the line. When adding your information to the form, be sure to use your name as listed on your State ID. Please return to your vehicle after entering the virtual line. We'd ask that you remain there while you wait to receive a text message.
About 30 minutes after the virtual line has opened, the line will be closed. Shortly after the virtual line has closed, randomly selected customers will receive text notifications to come into the store. Once at the entrance of the store:
A valid state-issued Driver's License/Identification Card must be presented to receive your voucher.

One (1) Video Card may be purchased within a 30-day period, per household.
Any duplicate entries in the virtual line will automatically be removed.
If you are randomly selected, you must arrive at the store's entrance within 10 minutes to claim your voucher. If you have not arrived within 10 minutes, the voucher will be forfeited and redistributed.
