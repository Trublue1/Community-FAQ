Hello everyone, I'm your local Dallas TX stores moderator @Zotac > AMD  Blu. and work with our stores community leaders @KrisCheetah and @MandaPanda to keep our chats friendly and within #deleted-channel , we are not in any way associated with the store or Micro Center but are very knowledgeable on how camping works at the store and the policies. My DM box is always open (thought it may take some time for me to respond at times) if you have any questions or issues.

For more immediate issues or serious violations of our rules you are more than welcome to DM @ModMail  and any member of staff from the server that happen to be online (could be from any store) will respond asap.

-- Discord notes --

1) Please do not post in #Stock-Alerts unless you are contributing stock information.

--General--

1) Regular shipments have been observed from Monday through Friday.

2) There is no shipment pattern. A large inventory shipment does not mean they will continue to receive large shipments. No shipment does not mean the supply is 'dry'. A large shipment to a regional store does not mean this store will receive a large shipment soon after.

3) Inventory on the Micro Center website is not accurate for items in high demand. Do not rely on the website for accurate in-stock information.

--Vouchers--

1)  DO NOT LINE UP BEFORE 9 AM. Mc is not honoring any "lists" or "lines" else where. If you line up before 9am you will be asked to leave. 

2) A QR code is given out at 9 AM to everyone if they have Nvidia cards. AMD cards are just stocked on the shelf. No vouchers for AMD as of now. Some managers post the QR code in the window at 9 with the stock sheet. 
3)  Please Do not post the QR code here. For now we will not allow it.  We are currently reviewing this rule to see if it will be allowed in the future, but for now do not advertise or post the QR code on this Discord.

4) Once you receive a text, It will be verified and you will be allowed to join the queue. You only have 10 minutes to check in with the text and a valid photo ID. (Passports do not count. Drivers license or state ID card).

5) You are only allowed to purchase 1 GPU every 30 days. A valid ID' is required and are checked before you get a voucher and again at the register. Do not discuss ways around this or any other MC store policies/rules on this Discord.
