𝙻𝚊𝚜𝚝 𝚎𝚍𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚍  4/4/22

Hello everyone, I'm your local Dallas TX stores moderator @trublu#0173 and work with our stores community leaders @KrisCheetah#4008 and @MandaPanda#9610 to keep our chats friendly and within #💬-tx-dfw-general-chat  , we are not in any way associated with the store or Micro Center but are very knowledgeable on how camping works at the store and the policies. My DM box is always open (thought it may take some time for me to respond at times) if you have any questions or issues.

For more immediate issues or serious violations of our rules you are more than welcome to DM @ModMail  and any member of staff from the server that happen to be online (could be from any store) will respond asap.

1) Please do not post in #Stock-Alerts unless you are contributing stock information.

```diff
--General--
```
1) Regular shipments have been observed from Monday through Friday.

2) There is no shipment pattern. A large inventory shipment does not mean they will continue to receive large shipments. No shipment does not mean the supply is 'dry'. A large shipment to a regional store does not mean this store will receive a large shipment soon after.

```diff
--Vouchers--
```

Currently, vouchers are not offered. All stock is going directly to the shelf for all products.

You are only allowed to purchase 1 Nvidia GPU every 30 days. A valid ID' is required and are checked before you get a voucher and again at the register. **Do not discuss ways around this or any other MC store policies/rules on this Discord**.
