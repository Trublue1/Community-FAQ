🟠 🟠 🟠 Methods of obtaining a GPU

1️⃣  QR Raffle Style

🔸 QR Raffle Style system goes LIVE at 9:00 AM and CLOSES at 9:30 AM

🔸 You must be on site at 9:00 AM in order to scan the QR code seen on a sheet taped to the window near the entrance area.

          ⚠️Do NOT crowd the entrance area out of respect for other in-store customers. Stay nearby your vehicle away from the store. 

🔸 You will be given instructions upon scanning the QR code via mobile. Carefully follow the instructions given to you and ensure you receive a CONFIRMATION TEXT at the end of the sign up process. 

🔸 Random selection will commence at 9:45 AM where selected winners will be advised via TEXT to line up next to the railing to the left side of the store entrance! You will get a voucher from RV Management at that time. You have ten minutes to join the line near the railing area if you get a text.

🔸 If you are called up to make your selection but do not see any card(s) you want, you must FORFEIT your voucher. You will need to re-present your ID again to confirm you were verified by the employee who handed you a voucher. You must bring the voucher to a cashier at check-out area where you hand them the voucher and they will retrieve the card assigned to the voucher. 

         ⚠️ An employee WILL verify your identity ; you MUST have a driver's license at the time of receiving a voucher or your selection will be discarded. All vouchers will be numbered.

🔸 All cards are FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED. Individuals with numbered vouchers will be asked to stand in a line near the railing area in order to purchase a card at this point in time. 

🔸 If you are called up to the counter to make your selection but do not see any card(s) you want, you must FORFEIT your voucher. You will need to re-present your ID again to confirm you were verified by the employee who handed you a voucher. 

          ⚠️  You CANNOT trade/sell or give away the voucher as it will be voided if you decide not to purchase anything at the counter

🔸 If you did not receive a text around 10:45 AM or LATER,  this means there are no CARDS available for purchase. Try again another day. 

          ⚠️  Keep in mind estimated time above is dependent on number of cards that arrives; the larger the GPU shipment is, the longer it will take to clear the QR Raffle queue.

2️⃣  FULL BUILDS

🔸  You walk into Micro Center and head straight to BYO (Build Your Own) department and speak with a BYO employee. 

🔸   We recommend you come prepared with a parts list that contains all the parts that is currently available and SOLD at MC. Meaning all parts you want to buy for your “full build” must be sold by MC. It will be easier for the employee and save time for both parties.

          ⚠️ All parts for price match purposes must be sold by a major retailer for Micro Center to able to price match

🔸  They will ask you for your GPU/CPU preferences; and you may be put on a “waitlist” that may take up to a month or longer, depending on the product.

🔸  Once all the parts comes in, including CPU/GPU, they will call you to come make the payment prior to picking up the parts.

🔸 RV requires full builds-related orders to be built by them. You must pay $150 minimum for the build fee  (required). 

          ❗ There are additional fees for certain services which can be found here > https://www.microcenter.com/site/service/instore-service-complete-build.aspx

           ⚠️ Above method is suitable for those who have NOT bought anything for their planned new build and do not have time to camp out overnight due to time constraints .

:CS_AlphabetF: :CS_AlphabetA: :CS_AlphabetQ:

⏺️ What happened to vouchers at opening?
Micro Center Corporate has decided to implement a new system called QR Raffle system which replaced the voucher-system previously used by RV Micro Center.

⏺️ What kind of cards can we expect to land at RV?
RV MC places orders for any cards they can get their hands on and is fulfilled by the distributor. They have no say in which brands they want to see more of. 

⏺️ What time should we start camping out?
Overnight lines is NO longer viable. You MUST be there IN PERSON by 9:00 AM to scan the QR code in order to be entered into the raffle system on a scheduled truck day.

⏺️ Do full builds get priority for GPUs arriving via the truck?
Yes, RV Staff will set aside some (or most) cards to meet other customers’ needs, including full build customers.

⏺️ Can I get two GPU’s in less than 30 days?
No – you are subject to a 30D CD (30 day cooldown period) where you can only purchase one GPU per 30 days.

⏺️ I just got a graphics card. My (family member) wants to get one too. Can they get a card?
Unfortunately no, they will not be able to get a card. Current Corporate Policy mandates 1 GPU per household per 30 days. This rule is subject to change at the discretion of Corporate Micro Center, however.

⏺️ The truck is late! What happens now?
The employee will record a list to record names. You must be there in line in order to sign up for the wait list in front of the employee. The employee will contact you with choices of cards to pick from. Follow further instructions from the employee in order to retrieve your card.

⏺️ Unable to view pricing for GPUs?
These are the following steps you must take in order to view pricing:
-Access Micro Center's website
-Type in the GPU you want to see the pricing for
-Change your “local store” to “shippable items” 
-Refresh the page and you will see pricing for said part.
