Video Card Buying Limits


ALL Video Cards are Limit 1 per Customer per 30 days

Any video card will trigger this, including clearance and low-end cards. EDIT: As of 4/15 "Bare Systems" now apply towards the rule, EX: Bitspower Titan-X [214775] However after speaking to store management, they will not be enforcing it on GT-710s and reserved the right to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

Q: "Can I buy an AMD card with the expectation to return it to buy an Nvidia once I get lucky?"

A: Don't be that guy buying a card as a placeholder. We want to support our local stores, and MC takes a loss on the opened merchandise. MC urges against it, but will allow the exchange... 

Q: "I bought another card a week ago, Can I exchange it for a different one?"

A: Yes, However you need to bring in the card you want to exchange that morning, and pay the difference for the new one. (Obviously)

Q: I really want a 3080, But they only have 3060s Should I buy it?

A: No, Don't be that guy. Buying a card you don't actually want eats up supply from someone else who actually wants to buy it. If you need a card to post-test your new build, buy a GT-710 as they don't contribute to the 1per30days rule.

Q: What do I need to bring to buy a video card from MC?

A: 1. A valid govt issued photo ID. 2. A phone to get on the wait-list. 3. Payment (obviously)
