1)  Micro Center is using a queue based system for purchasing GPU's in addition to the voucher system. The queue system is only deployed at two locations currently: Houston, TX and Fairfax, VA

2) To enter the queue, you go to the back of the store to the BYOPC section and request to join the GPU reservation list. Your ID will be asked for to confirm your information 

3) You will then be asked which card family you would like to make a reservation for (RTX 3070, RTX 3080, etc.). You cannot specify which AIB you would like (EVGA FTW3, Asus STRIX, etc.) 

4) You'll receive a verification text and email that contains links you'll need to access to confirm your spot

5) After verifying, you will receive a confirmation email indicating that you now have a spot in the queue

6) From that point, you just wait until you receive another email from Micro Center indicating your card is ready to pick up. You have 3 days from the email to pick up your card or else you'll be booted out of the queue and your card will be given to the next person waiting 

7) The queue currently has a limit of how many people can enter at one time. We are speculating the limit is 250 (TOTAL, not per card family) as that is the confirmed limit for the Fairfax, VA queue. Check back in the q-chat chat as users have been indicating when their reservations have been fulfilled, giving you an opportunity to take their place.

8) We also have an excel sheet that is tracking the movement of cards in the queue. We would all be really grateful if you could fill out the form indicated below once you sign up for the queue. Each contribution gives us a better idea of how far along the queue is.

--Vouchers are no longer first come first serve--

1) Camping is no longer a viable method to get a graphics card as a raffle system has been put into place

2) Every morning a couple of signs with a QR code will be placed at the front of the store

3) The QR code will take you to a site where you can sign up on the list for that day 

4) You have from 9:00AM to 9:30AM to sign up

5) Once the list closes, people from the list will be randomly selected for a voucher. You will receive a text indicating whether you won or lost. The losing text is along the lines of "Thank You! Please try again"

6) Winning texts begin going out at 9:30 (10:30 on Sundays). If you receive a winning text, you have 10 minutes to physically claim your spot in the line. Losing texts are sent out after all winners are chosen.

7) Winners may pick a purchase voucher from those available in the order they received their texts, so the first winner chosen has all the options available while those after pick from the leftovers.

8) If you get selected, you can go inside the store and purchase your card. Good luck!

Note: 
1 )If you purchase a card from the raffle or queue, no one from your household will be able to purchase a card from either for 30 days (even if you return the card). 
2)  If you are already in the queue and would like to request another card instead, you can change your queue spot to that card. However, you'll be in the back of the line for that card

ATTENTION:

The lottery/raffle system for GPUs has officially ENDED

https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-process-and-faq-updated-3-1-22

- All GPUs will now be first come first serve once the store opens.
- Basically whoever gets to the BYO counter first gets first "dibs" on available stock.
- No more raffle DOES NOT mean you can go back to camping outside the store before it opens.
- Online GPU stock should be accurate

Why Did They Remove The Raffle?
- A decent amount of stores seem to be having an "abundant stock" of Nvidia GPUs (-Chicago Microcenter Representative)

Please be respectful to the Microcenter Associates as you shop for your desired Graphics Card
