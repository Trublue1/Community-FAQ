--General--

1) Shipments typically arrive Wednesday and Friday Mornings. A large inventory shipment does not mean they will continue to receive large shipments. No shipment does not mean the supply is 'dry'. A large shipment to a regional store does not mean this store will receive a large shipment soon after.

2) Store associates do not have access to information about shipments ahead of time. We will receive important updates in üì¶-pa-stock-alerts. Please do not pester employees with questions about shipments, as they have do not have that information.

3) Inventory on the Micro Center website may not be 100% accurate for items in high demand. Do not rely on the website for accurate in-stock information. GPU stock left over from the raffle is typically updated and correct by the following day. 

4) The store does not have a phone number to contact them so do not try to text or call the number listed on the website. Everything is routed through their OH regional call center.

NO MORE RAFFLE

--Important Notes--

[Please do not line up outside the store overnight.]

If you return a GPU in hopes of getting a different one, please know that your 30 day cooldown will not be automatically reset. Please do not ask the employees to reset it for you as they do not have the ability to do so.

--FAQ‚Äôs--

If an item is listed as ‚Äúlimited availability,‚Äù is it in stock?

Most likely yes. It will still read ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù if it is out of stock.

There will be no more raffles from here on out. Graphics cards will be first come, first serve. That being said, please still respect the wishes of Microcenter and DO NOT line up outside overnight. Thank you.
