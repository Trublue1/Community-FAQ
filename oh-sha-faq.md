--General--
0) ðŸ“¦-oh-sha-stock-alerts IS ONLY FOR POSTING STOCK ALERTS KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE (INCLUDING ASKING ABOUT STOCK) IN THE OTHER CHANNELS

1) Store associates do not have access to information about shipments ahead of time and management will never share shipment information. It is not worth the time and effort to question them.

2) Inventory on the Micro Center website is not accurate for Nvidia 3xxx series. For Ryzen 5xxx CPUs and AMD 6xxx cards the website stock count is usually accurate.

3) The store does not have a phone number to contact them so do not try to text or call the number listed on the website. Everything is routed through their OH regional call center.

4) Customers may purchase one GPU of any type, per HOUSEHOLD with valid ID (drivers license or state id only), every 30 days.

NO MORE RAFFLE
THERE WON'T BE A RAFFLE IN THE MORNINGS ANYMORE YOU CAN LINE UP BEFORE THE STORE OPENS IF YOU WISH OR JUST GO IN AND BUY SOMETHING ONCE THEY OPEN

--Raffle--

1) The raffle is open from 9am to 9:30 am GPUs are only available on days the shuffle is occuring unless they are still unpurchased from a previous shuffle day.

2) You can enter by scanning the QR codes posted on the front of the store, do not post the code in the discord server 

3) At 10am the first confirmation texts will be sent out and customers will be able to pick their cards in the order of the virtual line 

4) If you don't show up within 10 minutes of receiving the confirmation text your spot will be given away

5) You must show a valid ID when picking up your card, only drivers licenses and state IDs are acceptable

6) If there are more cards then people who entered the virtual line the extra cards will be available to purchase for people who didn't enter the raffle

9) If you do not win the raffle it is possible to attempt the raffle at the Columbus Microcenter as it runs from 12 to 12:30, see their channels for more information

--Inventory--

1)  Inventory is received overnight via trucks. A truck's presence does not indicate they have received any high demand inventory (Radeon 6x GPU, NVDA 3x GPU, Ryzen 5x CPU).

2) The truck is located behind the store.

3) There is no way of knowing what will be in stock on any given day.
