**Q: How often does MC Madison Heights restock truck come?**
A: Trucks are known to come Tuesday - Friday, with no trucks on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.  Staff recently confirmed there will be no more trucks on Saturday.  (May 2021) 

**Q: What time does the store open?**
A:  Store opens at 10am unless otherwise noted on the website due to deep cleaning. Check the store webpage for the official list of hours. https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/madison-heights.aspx

**Q: Does MC Madison Heights get certain cards on certain days?**
A: Unknown, Tuesday - Friday all seem to have equal chances of getting a drop.  There seems to be a pattern of about 3-4 trucks per week.

**Q: What time should I be at Micro Center Madison Heights for the best chances?**
A: At store opening. This is for NVidia GPUs only; AMD are usually readily available in the case.

**Q: What if there are no cards that day?**
A: There is usually a stock sheet posted the night before under #ðŸ“¦-mi-stock-alerts. The quantity usually only shows 1 but it is unknown how many cards we actually get until the morning of when the store opens. 

**Q: Can I use a chair?**
A:  There is absolutely NO camping overnight - this was discontinued in May 2021. Usually Colleen or Store Employees will ask you to leave if you even try it.

**Q: How many GPUs/CPUs can I buy?**
A: At the present time, 1 GPU per household per 30 days. GT710? Counts towards that limit. NVidia 30 series and AMD counts. Only 1, no exceptions unless a return is made which a manager will need to override.

**Q: Can I return my current generation Nvidia / AMD product in exchange for a different one?**
A: Yes. But it only applies to cards that have been returned within the return period of 30 days.  You still need to wait in line to get a voucher for the card you want to exchange for and you need to bring it up to the counter with you when you go to checkout or you will not be allowed to purchase the new card.

**Q: How long does stock last?**
A: At the current time, it depends on the card. AMDs should be readily available on the shelf, but it's unknown as to what ones are actually in stock considering the website isn't updated. Nvidia cards sometimes last until close, sometimes not.

**Q: For one per person per household rule, Can multiple people from the same address buy a current gen AMD CPU, AMD GPU, & Nvidia 3000 series?**
A: No. The rules are outlined as one per person per household.

**Q: Does the Madison Height Micro-center post a stock manifest?**
A: As of late they have been posting it the night before, around 7pm indicating whether they will have stock the next day or not. If they do, stock usually only shows a qty of 1.
