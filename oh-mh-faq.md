--General--

1) There is no shipment pattern as far as quantity of products is concerned. A large inventory shipment does not mean they will continue to receive large shipments. No shipment does not mean the supply is 'dry'. A large shipment to a regional store does not mean this store will receive a large shipment soon after.

2) Store associates do not have access to information about shipments ahead of time and management will never share shipment information. It is not worth the time and effort to question them.

3) Inventory on the Micro Center website is not accurate for items in high demand. Do not rely on the website for accurate in-stock information.

4) The store does not have a phone number to contact them so do not try to text or call the number listed on the website. Everything is routed through their OH regional call center.

5) Photos of trucks and photos behind the store are prohibited. Additionally, keep photos in ðŸ§‘-oh-mh-line-chat and ðŸ“¦-oh-mh-stock-alerts .

--Inventory--

1)  Inventory is received midday via trucks. A truck's presence does not indicate they have received any high demand inventory (Radeon 6x GPU, NVDA 3x GPU, Ryzen 5x CPU).

2) Trucks typically arrive between 11am and 1pm. Inventory is unloaded from the truck and put on the shelves in the same day. Trucks do not arrive on weekends.

3) There is no way of knowing what will be in stock on any given day.**
