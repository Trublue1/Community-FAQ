- General Information & Guidelines - 

1) Regular Keystone shipments occur on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, though they are not guaranteed to carry GPUs. Delays and reschedulings do occasionally happen, in which case a shipment may come in on another day. Midday shipments via FedEx/UPS come in at random, with no predictability or regularity.

2) Shipments vary wildly in size. One might carry 10 cards, another 100, and another none. There is no observable pattern.

3) Shipment manifests are NOT posted to the window on shipment days.

4) This store does not allow any lines, and employs the lottery system for Nvidia 30-series GPUs:
At 8:30 AM on shipment days, the waitlist opens. To join it, scan the QR code posted at the store and follow the instructions on your phone. You must enter your name as it is printed on your ID.
At 9:00 AM, the waitlist closes.
At ~9:15 AM, random staggered selections begin. While waiting, please remain in your vehicle or outside. Do not crowd the entrance or wait inside the store.
If you are selected, you will receive a text message indicating as such. Once you receive your text message, head directly to the entrance with ID in-hand to retrieve your voucher. If you do not arrive within 10 minutes, your voucher will be forfeited. This is a hard limit.
Once all vouchers have been claimed, a text message will be dispatched.
. 
5) When it is your turn, head towards the Build Your Own section, you must present a valid state-issued drivers license/ID card to receive your voucher. Passports and photos of identification are not accepted. Student IDs are not accepted, unless you bring 2 forms of proof of address.

6) There's a strict 1 card per household per 30 days policy.  Do not attempt to subvert this rule, as doing so is unfair to others and would likely result in a ban from the store.

7) Please do not pester or harass store associates about availability. It is in their best interest to sell GPUs to gamers, and they have no incentive to lie to you. Treat them with respect, and they'll be sure to reciprocate.

8) Pricing is as reflected on the https://microcenter.com/ website. Search for the card/product you are looking for pricing on and make sure the My Store selection is set to "Shippable Item".

9) Do not post the QR code or corresponding link. Doing so will result in moderation action! For stock updates, please redact the QR code before posting. Thank you.

10) Please review the FAQs below, as well as the pinned messages in a given channel before posting. :checkthepinsaggressive:

- FAQs - 

1) Should I rely on the website for stock info?
Not for 30 series GPUs. As high-demand products typically sell out immediately after opening, stock is not updated on the site unless they remain unsold.

2) Is X product still in stock?
Keep your eyes on the üì¶-ny-wb-stock-alerts  channel, but do not ask your questions there. The channel is for stock updates only.

3) What time should I arrive at the store? Should I camp out overnight?
When you arrive matters not, as long as it is while the waitlist is open. While camping was previously a common occurrence at this store, the lottery system has rendered the practice obsolete.

4) How do vouchers work?
Vouchers are redeemable for a single card, but not any particular model or SKU. They do not guarantee you a time window, so it is recommended to head directly to the BYOPC counter as soon as you receive yours. Once at the counter, you‚Äôll be able to select your card of choice from what‚Äôs still available. The sale, transfer or trading of vouchers is strictly prohibited by Micro Center policy, as well as our server rules.

5) What happens if cards are left over post-lottery?
Leftover cards are placed on shelves, and made available to walk-in customers (usually at 10:20). 

6) I can't make it in the morning. Do I still have a chance?
While uncommon, midday drops do happen on occasion. Also see the above question.

7) Are AMD or previous-gen Nvidia cards subject to the lottery?
No. They‚Äôre placed directly on shelves, and do not require vouchers to purchase.

8) I'm looking to purchase a prebuilt or parts for a complete system. Are there any accommodations in place for me?
Let an associate know you intend to purchase a prebuilt/complete system, and they may be able to accommodate you.
.
9) Does this store allow GPU exchanges?
While exchanges are allowed depending on circumstance, don't be that guy who purchases a card they don't need in hopes of exchanging it. It's a dishonorable practice that directly hurts associates, and can result in restrictions on your future returns.

10) What‚Äôs up with pricing? Is Micro Center scalping cards?!
No, Micro Center is not scalping cards. There are multiple factors that go into pricing, which I will attempt to break down for you.
Pricing generally follows this formula: Nvidia MSRP + AIB markup + tariffs + distributor markup + retailer markup.
Nvidia MSRP - The initial ‚Äúmanufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price‚Äù set by Nvidia/AMD at launch.
AIB markup - The markup set by a given add in board partner (e.g. EVGA or ASUS). This covers the costs associated with developing and manufacturing the unique cooler designs you‚Äôll find on AIB cards, which often outperform their reference/founders edition (Nvidia/AMD designed) counterparts.
Tariffs - There is currently a 25% tariff on many Chinese imports, including graphics cards. As you can imagine, this has had a gargantuan effect on pricing. It also explains the seemingly-unjustifiable price gaps between cards from different AIBs. For example, EVGA does a significant portion of their manufacturing in Taiwan, rendering their cards as the cheapest option. In fact, the difference is so stark that selling an EVGA 3080Ti for the price of an ASUS 3080Ti would be a violation of this Discord‚Äôs scalping rule. Crazy, right?
Distributor markup - The markup set by the distributors, who sell the cards to retailers.
Retailer markup - The markup set by retailers, such as Micro Center. This markup is typically very low, if at all existent (especially in today‚Äôs climate).
.
11) How can I identify identify LHR (lite hash rate) cards?
All 3070Ti and 3080Ti cards are LHR, and all 3060s are limited (originally driver-level, now LHR). 3090s are all non-LHR. For 3060Ti/3070/3080:
ASUS: "V2" in P/N (e.g. TUF-RTX3080-O10G-V2-GAMING)
EVGA: "-KL" or "-KH" P/N suffix (e.g. 10G-P5-3897-KL)
Gigabyte: "Rev 2.0" in P/N (e.g. GV-N3080AORUS M-10GD Rev2.0) (Rev3.0 for 3080 Aorus Master, 3060Ti Gaming OC Pro)
MSI: "LHR" marking along with model name (e.g. 3080 SUPRIM X 10G LHR). From Reddit: "One unofficial way is to look at MFG year/month (13th-16th number in serial number, like "2106") and check, 2106 and later has a high chance of LHR card."
Zotac: "LHR" along with P/N (e.g. ZT-A30800D-10PLHR)
PNY: "LHR" along with model name, "L" in SKU (e.g. VCG308010LTFXPPB)

ATTENTION:

The lottery/raffle system for GPUs has officially ENDED

https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-process-and-faq-updated-3-1-22

- All GPUs will now be first come first serve once the store opens.
- Basically whoever gets to the BYO counter first gets first "dibs" on available stock.
- No more raffle DOES NOT mean you can go back to camping outside the store before it opens.
- Online GPU stock should be accurate

Why Did They Remove The Raffle?
- A decent amount of stores seem to be having an "abundant stock" of Nvidia GPUs (-Chicago Microcenter Representative)

Please be respectful to the Microcenter Associates as you shop for your desired Graphics Card
