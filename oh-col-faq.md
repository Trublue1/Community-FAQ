THE QR VIRITUAL LINE PROCESS HAS ENDED AS OF 3/2/2022. GPUs are first come first serve.

The 30-day policy is still in effect. The Micro Center policy is ONE GPU PURCHASE PER HOUSEHOLD every 30 days. On the 31st day from your purchase, you may purchase another GPU. A valid state-issued Drivers License or Identification card is required to complete your purchase for GPUs at this time.

The availability of graphics card is still dependent on what the store receives each day. There is no shipping pattern. Store associates do not have access about shipments ahead of time, and management will not share shipment information. It is not worth your time to question or ask them. 
GPU deliveries only occur M-F. Open box are your only hope on the weekend, and those are rare.

Inventory levels on the website should be up to date for all GPUs as of 3/2/2022. You may also use the ðŸ“¡-oh-col-mc-pricing channel to check levels of stock. 

The Columbus location does not have a phone number to contact them directly. Everything is routed through the OH regional call center. 

Additionally, GPU stock will be unloaded from the truck and put up on the shelf immediately for sale. This means that GPU stock could come from the morning or afternoon truck, as before.
