Micro Center Policies

‚ùó  GPU purchases MUST be validated through a government issued ID. Student ID's and library cards are rarely accepted.

‚ùó  GPU purchases are limited to ONE card PER PERSON every 30 DAYS. You will not be allowed to circumvent this rule.

‚ùó  Camping out is prohibited by the property managers of the Brentwood Promenade. Camping out for a GPU may lead to being banned from purchasing at the store.

‚ùó  A small number of cards are held for Micro Center service builds. There is a fee for service builds, though it may be a more surefire way to get a GPU. IF YOU PURCHASE A SERVICE BUILD, YOU CANNOT RETURN THE OTHER COMPONENTS AND KEEP THE GPU.
