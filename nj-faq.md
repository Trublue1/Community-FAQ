- General Microcenter FAQ -
 
1) There is no set shipment schedule. Regular shipments can occur from T - F (raffle times). Weekend shipments are rare (<5%) and are only due to delayed shipments or inventory held back. 
7/2 Update: Appears the lottery is only being conducted Tues - Fri. Be mindful lining up over the weekend and Mondays.

2) How has recent stock been? Horrible! (6/27 Update: Inventory has started to improve especially for 3080s 7/12 Update: No stock received all week so stock might be going back to being horrible again)

3) What stock did they receive today/this morning? We don't actively follow the chat so either read the other chat logs to determine if stock was reported. If no stock was reported, then we have no inventory information.

4) A large inventory shipment does not mean they will continue to receive large shipments. No shipment does not mean the supply is 'dry'. A large shipment to a regional store does not mean this store will receive a large shipment soon after. We and Microcenter employees have no idea what version will be coming in nor the quantity of the shipment. Inventory significantly varies day over day and is unpredictable.

5) Store associates do not have access to information about shipments ahead of time. It is not worth the time and effort to question them.

6) The store does not have a phone number to contact them so do not try to text or call the number listed on the website. Everything is routed through their OH regional call center.

7) The GPU you choose depends on many factors including usage, your budget, and stock availability

8) Beggars cannot be choosers â€“ do not be picky for which variant. If you can buy a GPU, buy whatever they have available.

9) There is a 30-day buying policy that is strictly enforced for ALL GPUs including older models. You cannot purchase a GPU within the 30-day window. They will ID you and check your license/account information to verify your purchase. 
- Microcenter Voucher Information -
 
There is now a Micro Center FAQ page that answers many questions about the new raffle system (Microshuffle - Trademark in progress) vouchers and the voucher process.  The FAQ can be found here: https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-raffle-system-and-faq/p1?new=1

The raffle opens up at 9am each morning. The raffle will close at 9:30am each morning. The random selection process will happen at 9:45am each morning. The QR code is changed everyday.

Winners will be notified via text message. A voucher is given out to those who win the Microshuffle that morning starting at 9:45am. They notify the winners by 4-5 people at a time to avoid a big crowd of people waiting for BYOPC at the same time. A voucher is only good for that day and expires within 10 minutes after notification.

- Microcenter Inventory Information -
 
1)  Inventory is received overnight via trucks. Trucks normally arrive between 1-3am. This does not indicate they have received any high demand inventory (Radeon 6x GPU, NVDA 3x GPU, Ryzen 5x CPU).

2) Drop shipments are no longer received at this location. They only received shipments via truck.

3) This location received the FE for the 3070 and 3060TI initial launches. They did not have the FE for the 3090 and 3080 initial launches. Also, they have not received any FE variants for the 3070 and 3060TI post initial launch. They did receive 3080TI FE post initial launch - did not receive any 3080 TI FE on initial launch.

4) Inventory on the Micro Center website is not accurate for items in high demand. Do not rely on the website for accurate in-stock information. (7/19 Update: MC website is accurate for stock information for AMD cards such as 6700xt and 6900xt.

ATTENTION:

The lottery/raffle system for GPUs has officially ENDED

https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-process-and-faq-updated-3-1-22

- All GPUs will now be first come first serve once the store opens.
- Basically whoever gets to the BYO counter first gets first "dibs" on available stock.
- No more raffle DOES NOT mean you can go back to camping outside the store before it opens.
- Online GPU stock should be accurate

Why Did They Remove The Raffle?
- A decent amount of stores seem to be having an "abundant stock" of Nvidia GPUs (-Chicago Microcenter Representative)

Please be respectful to the Microcenter Associates as you shop for your desired Graphics Card
