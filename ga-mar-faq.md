GPU Stock and Process

Basic Information
- The Marietta Micro Center has a one GPU per household per 30 days policy on ALL GPUs.  This policy applies chain-wide (i.e. if you have bought a GPU at another Micro Center in the last 30 days, you will not be able to buy at Marietta)
- A valid, state-issued ID is required to purchase a GPU
- At this point, with very rare exception, all Nvidia 3000-series GPUs EXCEPT 3090's are Lite Hash Rate (this is a hardware limiter from Nvidia which reduces the card's effectiveness at mining Ethereum - it does not impact gaming performance)
- Micro Center does not regularly receive Founder's Edition cards - these are only available from Best Buy (as well some System Integrators)
- The prices on the Micro Center website are accurate.  Make sure you are looking at the tab including all items, not just those in stock at your preferred store. Occasionally, the prices will not show up on the site - change your store to "shippable items" to show prices.  All prices are subject to 6% sales tax
- Micro Center does sell some prior generation Nvidia cards.  They carry 710, 730, 1030, 1050Ti, 1650 Super, 1660 Super, 1660Ti and 2060.  These cards are not included in the raffle.  They are put directly on the shelf and can be purchased during store hours.  They are still subject to the 1 GPU per 30 day rule.  More details on exact options and pricing can be found on the Micro Center website

Shipment Days
- Marietta receives GPU shipments on Tuesday/Thursday/Friday
- These shipments are not guaranteed - there are definitely "normal" shipment days where they do not receive any GPUs and shipments that come in unexpectedly on other days 
GPU Distribution Process
-Micro Center has ended the raffle/voucher distribution method at this time.  All GPUs will go directly to the shelf and are available on a first come, first serve basis.
-We no longer anticipate getting advanced notice of incoming stock.  Check the website for available inventory (not guaranteed to be accurate, but should be close). 
GPU Frequently Asked Questions

- How many cards does Marietta receive in a shipment?
    -- This varies greatly.  It can be 0 and it can be 191 (and anything in between).

- I'm looking for <insert specific card>, when will they have it?
    -- There is really no telling.  Any card that is listed on the website, they could receive (and even some that aren't listed yet like new releases).  There is no rhyme or reason to which cards they get when.

- Does the store ever have cards outside of the morning truck shipments?
    -- Yes, but it is very infrequent.  This can come from parcel shipments received by the store in the middle of the day (infrequent and unpredictable) or returns that are released to the shelf. 

- I think there are some Micro Center employees on the server, is it okay if I DM them with questions?
    -- No, please do not DM employees.  If you need support, contact server staff or tag the person in a message on an open channel and allow them to respond to you as needed.  Remember, employees post here to be helpful to us and are under no obligation to provide information or support. 
CPU Stock
At this point, stock of all current gen CPUs is pretty good.  Stock on the website should be reliable

DDR5 Stock
DDR5 stock appears to be much better.  That said, we don't know specifically when the store will receive new stock and there is no specific process for distribution.  Check the store and the website as it can be reserved when available.
