What are the store hours?
Monday to Saturday: 10am-9pm. Sunday 11am to 6pm

How do I get a GPU?
Ah yes, the burning question of the day. Well, my friend, you have come to the right place in search of your GPU quest. Some may say that its easier and best to get one online, but c’mon let us not kid ourselves. Unless you are a whiz kid programmer who is good enough to write your own shopping bot, the chance of getting a GPU online is low. For those with no programming folds in the brain, you have may think that you can smash that F5 key on your browser from the comfort of your home in sweats, but have you really been successful? Is that not why you have come to this discord server… so read on!

How do I know if Yonkers MC has GPUs right now (or other high demand items)?
Well, the short answer is you don’t unless you are physically at the store. Or, there’s a kind fellow discorder who’s at the store and willing to post an update in the #-ny-ynk-stock-alerts channel.

Why can’t I look on the MC store website for product availability?
The MC store website is actually pretty good for product availability for a lot of items, including open box items. What it’s not good for is showing current inventory of GPUs (and sometimes other high demand, fast moving products like CPUs.) Bummer, right?

But the website says there’s ‘Limited Availability’ of a GPU… what does that mean?
MC’s website is like a bad relationship… always telling you something and trying to get you to come over, but it’s really just a tease… a professional troller, a relationship ghoster. While you think ‘limited availability’ means that there is some limited availability of stock available in store, the reality is that 99.9% of the time there is not. Rushing to the store when you see ‘limited availability’ will definitely result in tears and disappointment. 
Is the only way to get a GPU by camping, and if so, what does that mean?
So you keep reading that people need to ‘camp’ to get their GPU. This is just another way of saying you have to wait inline, (or queue if you’re British). Getting in line could be as short as 1-2 hours (increasingly not likely scenario) or it could be an overnight adventure that might last 24 hours, or longer!

So when should I plan on getting in line?
First of all, remember the first rule of getting in line (or camping out). Know what days there are regular truck deliveries. The last thing you want to do is be that idiot that lines up when there’s no delivery truck. Regular deliveries at Yonkers are Wednesday and Fridays – so these are the two days to plan for on your GPU quest.

Do deliveries come on other days?
Its certainly possible that there could be deliveries on non-regular truck days, or drop shipments that get delivered to the store. But to be honest, those are super rare and don’t happen frequently or with regularity to consider planning around.
Any suggestions on maximizing my chances of getting a GPU?
Absolutely! There’s two factors in maximizing your chances of getting a GPU. The first factor is one you can control - the second factor is one that you cannot control: 

The first factor is what place in line you are. Ideally, you want to be #1 in line. That means if there are GPUs that day, you have the first choice of available cards and the world is good. If you want a specific card (eg. 3080 or 3090), ideally you want to be in one of the top 5 spots. If you are okay with any card type, then just try and be as close to the front of the line as possible. Remember – everyone else is trying to do the same… so the earlier you can get in the line, the better your chances. Some people have started camping out 12-14+ hours in advance of store opening, no joke. 

The second factor is the number of GPUs on a truck. The truck could have 5, 10 or 30+ cards. Or it could have 0 cards for that day. Yonkers MC doesn’t post or share card inventory in advance. Obviously, the more the better for everyone in line, but be prepared for 0. It can and has happened to many disappointed people, and likely means you’ll be repeating your line-up adventure on another day.

Where do people line up, where do people sleep, what is roll-call?
The line up usually starts outside along the side of the store. Some people will bring chairs or tents to sit or sleep in. Usually the first person in line will start a list depending on how early you get there. This is not an officially store list, but rather just to keep the overnight line in order. There is usually a roll call every 3 hours depending on the person running the list. If you are physically standing/sitting in a chair or in a tent, you’re usually good for roll call. But if you decide to wait in your car (somewhat frowned upon), just make sure you show up for roll call time. If you don’t, your name will/may get crossed off the list and you lose your spot.
What happens when the store opens and there are GPUs in stock?
At 10am the gates of heaven will open… errr I mean the store doors will open. A manager will usually ask the line to follow him in an orderly fashion single file to the BYOPC area. You will then each take a turn filling out your name and what GPU you want. The manager will then go down this official store list and hand out vouchers for actual inventory. You then take the voucher to a cashier to pay and check out. One thing to note, because Yonkers MC doesn’t usually start unpacking the truck until the store opens, it often takes a couple hours to empty the truck. So even though you have your voucher, you often times have to wait until late morning or noonish to be able to actually pay and walk out of the store with your GPU.
You must have a state ID and credit/debit card and no cash, or else you can’t get a card. The store limits 1 card per household every 30 days and will check your purchase history.

What if I need to use the bathroom?
If you need to use the bathroom, there’s a gas station just down the street to use. Don’t be that person that uses the stairs as their toilet.

Any line-up pro tips?
Pro-tip #1: When you are waiting in line, talk to your line neighbors and introduce yourself. They are generally interesting/cool/fun people. The other reason for being friendly is that if you do need to leave the line to go to the bathroom, to get something from your car, to get food or a beverage, you can ask/tell your line mates to watch your spot. If you do need to leave the line, don’t disappear for more than an hour. If so, you are going to make a lot of people very angry at you.
Pro-tip #2: Be kind to your line mates and look out for each other! 
Why is there not a lot of chatter in the NY Yonkers channels and why does it seem like no one likes to provide line or stock updates?
That’s a great question! This discord is yours and you’re part of this community. If you want info about the line or hear of stock details, please post yourself! Other people’s knowledge and collectively wisdom will get you your coveted GPU… so please take a moment and pass it forward with posts/updates if you are already in line or stock updates that you hear of while at the store.

Good luck and may the GPU gods look favorably upon you in your quest!

ATTENTION:

The lottery/raffle system for GPUs has officially ENDED

https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/8756/random-selection-process-and-faq-updated-3-1-22

- All GPUs will now be first come first serve once the store opens.
- Basically whoever gets to the BYO counter first gets first "dibs" on available stock.
- No more raffle DOES NOT mean you can go back to camping outside the store before it opens.
- Online GPU stock should be accurate

Why Did They Remove The Raffle?
- A decent amount of stores seem to be having an "abundant stock" of Nvidia GPUs (-Chicago Microcenter Representative)

Please be respectful to the Microcenter Associates as you shop for your desired Graphics Card
