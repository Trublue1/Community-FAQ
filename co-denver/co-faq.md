**Q: I’m new here, how do I find my GPU/CPU/DDR5?**
A: Watch the <#806952358118293554> channel or the <#826844265690300466> channel for updates on current stock. What’s posted is what we know. If a shipment of GPUs was received overnight, it should be entered into the system and theoretically shown on the website before store opening, if not all other drops are first come first serve and may appear in store before the website. Website inventory used to take 24 hours to populate, but as of March 2022 this has proposedly changed and is a reasonably accurate way of checking inventory.  Remember that ghost stock can and will appear on the website though, be nice to employees if unavailable.

**Q: Are there limits to purchasing?**
A: The only current limit in place is for all Nvidia cards, 1 card per 30 days (rolling).  While intended just for the RTX 30XX series, they do not have a system level way to differentiate at the register, and purchase of older generation nvidia cards will lock you out for 30 days. Be sure to have your ID ready and present to the BYO employees for any GPU purchase though.

**Q: Do all deliveries contain GPUs/CPUs/DDR5?**
A: No, because of the shortage Micro Center receives what is sent to them, there is no steady incoming stock. This includes the nightly warehouse shipments as well as the random mid-day shipments.  Despite possible correlations, they are truly random and there is no pattern.
